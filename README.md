# Tokenized Strategy Mix for Yearn V3 strategies

This repo will allow you to write, test and deploy V3 "Tokenized Strategies".

You will only need to override the three functions in Strategy.sol of `_invest`, `freeFunds` and `_totalInvested`. With the option to also override `_tend`, `tendTrigger`, `availableDepositLimit` and `availableWithdrawLimit` if desired.

## Strategy Writing

### Good to know

To create your own tokenized strategy you will need to override at least 3 functions outlined in `Strategy.sol`. An in depth description for each function is provide above each function in `Strategy.sol`.

It is important to remeber the defualt behavior for the any tokenized strategy is to be a permisionless vault, so functions such as _invest and _freeFunds can be called by anyone and care should be taken when implementing manipulatable logic such as swaps/lp movements. Strategists can choose to limit deposit/withdraws by overriding the `availableWithdrawLimit` and `availableDepositLimit` function if it is needed for safety.

It is recommended to build strategies on the assumption that reports will happen based on the strategies specific `profitMaxUnlockTime`. Since this is the only time _totalInvested will be called any strategies that need more frequent checks, updates should override then _tend and tendTrigger functions for any needed mid report maintanance.

The only global variable from the BaseTokenizedStrategy that can be access from storage is `asset`. If other global variables are needed for your specific implementation you can use the default `TokenizedStrategy` variable to easily retrieve any other needed variables withen the implementation such as totalAssets, totalDebt, isShutdown etc.

EX:

    require(!TokenizedStrategy.isShutdown(), "strategy is shutdown");

NOTE: It is not possible to write to the global storage state of a strategy internally post deployment. You will need to make external calls from the `manamagement` address to configure any of the desired variables.

To include permisioned function such as extra setters the two modifiers of `onlyManagement` and `onlyManagementAndKeepers` are available by default.

Cloning is available natively through the BaseTokenizedStrategy and can also be done easily using `TokenizedStrategy.clone(...)`. The cloning function will initialize all defualt storage needed for the BaseTokenizedStrategy as sepecified in the parameters of the clone function, but an internal initialize function will need to be used for any implementation specific initialization such as approvals.

NOTE: When cloning while using Periphery Helpers you should make sure to reset all variables from the helper contract that will be used. The periphery contracts leave all global variables as non-constants so they can be overriden by the implementations. This means when cloning they will all default back to 0, address(0) etc.

The symbol used for each tokenized strategy is set automatically with a standardized approach based of the `asset`'s symbol. Strategists should use the `name` parameter in constructor for a unique and descriptive name that encapsulates their specific strategy. Normal naming conventions will include the asset name, the protocol used to generate yield and the method rewards are sold if applicaple. ie: "Weth-AaveV3Lender-UniV3Swapper".

All other functionality such as reward selling, emergency functions, upgradability etc. is up to the strategist to determine what fits their vision the best. Due to the ability for strategies to stand alone from a Vault it is expected and encouraged for strategists to experiment with more complex, risky or previously unfeasible strategies.

## Periphery

To make strategy writing as simple as possible there is a suite of optional 'Periphery Helper' contracts that can be inherited by your strategy to provide standardized and tested functionality for things like swaps. A full list of the periphery contracts can be view here https://github.com/Schlagonia/tokenized-strategy-periphery.

All periphery contracts are completely optional and strategist are free to use them or not.

### APR Oracles

In order for easy integration with Vaults, frontends, debt allocaters etc. There is the option to also create an apr oracle contract for your specific contract implementation that should return the expected apr of the strategy based on some given debtChange. 

### HealthCheck

### Report Triggers


## Testing

Due to the nature of the BaseTokenizedStrategy utilizing an external contract for the majority of its logic the default interface for any tokenized strategy will not allow proper testing of all functions. Testing of your strategy should utilize the pre built `IStrategyInterface` interface to cast any deployed strategy through for testing as seen in the confest example. You can add any external functions that you add for your specific implementation to this interface to be able to test all functions with one variable. 

E.X.

    strategy = management.deploy(project.Strategy, asset, name)
    strategy =  project.IStrategyInterface.at(strategy.address)

Due to the permisionless nature of the tokenized strategies all tests are written without integration with any meta vault funding it. While those tests can be added all V3 vaults utilize the ERC-4626 standard for deposit/withdraws and accounting so they should be able to be plugged in easily to any number of different vaults with the same `asset`.

#### Errors:

"DecodingError: Output corrupted.": Probaably due to not running on a forked chain or a chain where the TokenizedStrategy contract isnt deployed.
"No conversion registered to handle": Check the `IStrategyInterface` interface the tests are using is up to date.

### Deployment

#### Contract Verification

Once the strategy is fully deployed and verified you will need to verfity the TokenizedStrategy functions as well. To do this navigate to the /#code page on etherscan.

1. Click on the `More Options` drop down menu. 
2. Click "is this a proxy?".
3. Click the "Verify" button .
4. Click "Save". 

This should add all of the external `TokenizedStrategy` functions to the contract interface on Etherscan.
